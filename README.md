# Pavan Mistry's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my work and includes both a Node.js backend and a Vite-React frontend.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- **`portfolio-backend`**: Contains the Node.js backend for handling API requests and data management.
- **`portfolio-frontend`**: Contains the Vite-React frontend for the user interface of the portfolio.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.13 or higher)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pavan1003/Portfolio.git
   cd Portfolio
   ```

#### Backend

1. Navigate to the `portfolio-backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8888`.

#### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `portfolio-frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

You can view the portfolio by opening your browser and navigating to the frontend application URL. The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch and display data.
